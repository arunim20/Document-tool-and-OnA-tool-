 G. I would say that a minority can do much more in the way of non violence then a majority. I had an English friend called Symonds. He used to say: I am with you so long as you are in a minority. After you are in a majority we are quits. I had less diffidence in handling my minority in South Africa than I had here in handling a majority. But it would be wholly wrong therefore to say that non violence is a weapon of the weak. The use of non violence requires greater bravery than that of violence. When Daniel defied the laws of the Meads and Persians, his action was non violent.
