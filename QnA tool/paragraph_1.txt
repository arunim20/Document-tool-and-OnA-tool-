 KAKA, You seem to be working the wrong way. I may put it thus: the relation continues to be like that between master and maid. You did not think of your earlier resolves; did not consider the earlier letter nor did you wait for Maganlal to come. I have letters from all the teachers. Much of what I have said to you applies to them as well. I shall accept whatever you decide after consulting Maganlal. Dont let my illness come in the way. Make no tentative decision. There should be no violence if you reach a decision on merits. Regard the Ashram and the school as belonging to you all and do what you please without taking my presence into account. Dont worry on my account. You can all be regarded as wise, so I do not have to cheer you up. Now what is there to follow except death? Let that too come by the 13th of April, 1928. This interval is not too short for the attainment of swaraj in my lifetime. I am growing more and more convinced that only the reign of the spinning wheel will bring swaraj; dedicate your lives to establishing it, if you all have the faith I have.
